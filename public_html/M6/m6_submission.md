Static changes like hard-coded colors/values will not count at all (i.e., changing shapes/colors/values that are globally defined and set only once). You may however change such values through game logic during runtime.

The players<br>square now needs to avoid colliding with the obstacle to prevent the game<br>from ending prematurely. The obstacles position is randomly set using moveObstacle, and collision<br>detection with the obstacle is implemented in the draw function.</span><br></p><br></td></tr>

<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <div>The event listeners were changed to track the WASD keys rather than the<br>arrow keys for controls. Based on the new key codes (87 for W,<br>65 for A, 83 for S, and 68 for D), the movement flags<br>(up, down, left, and right) are set appropriately. Added Difficulty: As the player's<br>score rises, I added logic to increase the target square's speed. The corrected<br>code that was previously provided did not, however, incorporate this particular change.Power-ups: I<br>first introduced them as squares that might appear at random on the canvas.<br>The powerUpActive variable shows how long the player's square is activated after collecting<br>a power-up. MovePowerUp() sets the power-up's position at random, while the draw() function<br>implements collision detection and power-up functionality.</div><br></td></tr>
